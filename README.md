# realTimeChatApp

Created a full Realtime Chat Application. We're going to use React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end.

Now I have a strong understanding of how to send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.

Setup:

run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the development server
